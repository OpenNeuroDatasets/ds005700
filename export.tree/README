## NeuroEmo: An fMRI Dataset for Emotion Recognition

  
 Description: The purpose of the study is to enable emotion recognition analysis using culturally relevant stimuli, such as Indian Bollywood movie clips, in fMRI data collected from Indian participants. This dataset explores the neural basis of emotions in a contextually meaningful way, focusing on functional and dynamic connectivity.


## Summary

This dataset contains raw fMRI data collected from 40 healthy participants who watched emotional Indian movie videos clips.
Tasks included resting-state and emotion-elicitation tasks. Data was organized following the BIDS standard. 
Dataset size: 7.21 GB (raw BIDS-compliant format), 20 GB (raw DICOM files).

The data was collected at fMRI center of Central Institute of Psychiatry (CIP), Kanke, Ranchi.The research proposal and experimental protocol received ethical clearance from the Institute Ethics Committee, CIP (No. IEC/CIP/2022-23/1709).

## Acquisition details:
Scanner: Philips Ingenia 3T MRI scanner with following parameter-
-T1w data was collected for matrix size 192x192x256, voxel size 1x1x1 mm, slice thickness 1, space between slices 1, echo time 0.002943, repetition time 0.0065, flip angle 9^°. 
-Task-rest_bold was collected for matrix size 96x96x38, voxel size -2.29x2.29x4 mm, slice thickness 4, space between slices 4, echo time 0.035001, repetition time 2.02697, flip angle 90^°, slice 38.
-Task-fe_bold was collected for matrix size 128x128x36, voxel size =-1.8x1.8x4 mm, slice thickness 4, space between slices 4, echo time 0.035, repetition time 3, flip angle  90^°, slice 36.

## Stimulus videos

Videos used as stimuli were selected from [Mishra, S., Srinivasan, N., Asif, M., and Tiwary, U.S., 2023. Affective film dataset from India (AFDI): Creation and validation with an Indian sample. Journal of Cultural Cognitive Science, 7(3), pp. 255–267] based on their potential to evoke emotions. The videos were downloaded in high quality and cropped to 30-second clips to elicit specific emotions corresponding to five emotion classes: Calm (Movie scene-calm, relax), Afraid (Movie scene-horror), Delighted (Movie scene-joyKolaveri), Depressed (Movie scene-Madari movie) and Excited (Movie scene-funTamma).

## Tasks
Participants viewed movie clips designed to evoke different emotions task details:

Onset (s) | Duration (s) | Emotion
0 | 30 | Calm
30 | 30 | White noise
60 | 30 | Afraid
90 | 30 | White noise
120 | 30 | Delighted
150 | 30 | White noise
180 | 30 | Depressed
210 | 30 | White noise
240 | 30 | Excited
270 | 30 | White noise
300 | 30 | Delighted
330 | 30 | White noise
360 | 30 | Depressed
390 | 30 | White noise
420 | 30 | Calm
450 | 30 | White noise
480 | 30 | Excited
510 | 30 | White noise
540 | 30 | Afraid
570 | 30 | White noise
